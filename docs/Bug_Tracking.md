  - Format check (dart format)
  - Unit test coverage (>80%)

Pre-merge Requirements:
  - All tests passing
  - Code review approved
  - No critical lint warnings
  - Documentation updated
```

### 2. Testing Pyramid

                      - Utilities
```

### 3. Monitoring & Alerts

**Crash Reporting**:
```dart
// Firebase Crashlytics integration
void main() {
  FlutterError.onError = FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordFlutterError;
  
  runZonedGuarded(() {
    runApp(MyApp());
  }, (error, stack) {
    FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordError(error, stack);
  });
}
```
