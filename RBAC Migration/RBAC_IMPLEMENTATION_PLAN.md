# RBAC Implementation Plan - PakeAja CRM

## Summary

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for the PakeAja CRM. This implementation provides granular permission management, role hierarchy, and organization-based data isolation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema ✅
- **Organizations**: Multi-tenant support structure
- **User Roles**: 8 distinct roles (admin, manager, sales, estimator, project_manager, foreman, inspector, client)
- **Permissions**: Granular resource-action based permissions
- **Teams & Territories**: Hierarchical team structure and territory management
- **Audit Logs**: Complete audit trail for all permission-related actions
- **Role Hierarchy**: Inheritance-based permission system

### 2. TypeScript Types & Interfaces ✅
- Complete type definitions in `src/types/rbac.ts`
- Compatibility layer in `src/types/auth-compat.ts` for backward compatibility
- Role labels and descriptions for UI display

### 3. Authentication Context Enhancement ✅
- Updated `AuthContext` with new RBAC methods:
  - `checkPermission()`: Check specific resource-action permissions
  - `hasRole()`: Check if user has specific role(s)
  - `canAccessResource()`: Check resource access
  - `refreshPermissions()`: Clear permission cache
- Permission caching for performance (5-minute cache)
- Organization-based permission loading

### 4. Middleware Protection ✅
- Route-based permission checking in `src/middleware/rbac.ts`
- Automatic redirection based on user role
- API route permission helpers
- Integration with Next.js middleware

### 5. UI Components ✅
- **User Profile Page** (`/dashboard/profile`):
  - Avatar upload
  - Personal information management
  - Work information display
  - Role visibility
- **User Management Page** (`/dashboard/users`):
  - User listing with search and filters
  - Role assignment (admin only)
  - Active/inactive status toggle
  - Department and contact information
- **Unauthorized Page** (`/unauthorized`):
  - Clean error display for permission denials

### 6. Dashboard Navigation ✅
- Dynamic navigation based on permissions
- Role-based menu visibility
- User dropdown with profile link
- Admin section for privileged users

## Database Migration Status

### Required Actions:
1. **Apply RBAC Schema**: Run the migration to create the RBAC tables
2. **Fix Existing Data**: Apply the profiles fix migration
3. **Seed Initial Data**: Create default organization and permissions

### Migration Commands:
```bash
# Option 1: Apply via Supabase CLI
npx supabase db push

# Option 2: Apply directly in Supabase Dashboard
# Go to SQL Editor and run migrations in order:
# 1. 20250108_create_rbac_schema.sql
# 2. 20250108_fix_profiles_rbac.sql
```

## Role Permissions Matrix

| Role | Key Permissions | Access Level |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Admin** | Full system access | Everything |
| **Manager** | Team oversight, reports, approvals | All except system settings |
| **Sales** | Leads, opportunities, quotes | Own and team data |
| **Estimator** | Calculations, quotes, materials | Read all, create quotes |
| **Project Manager** | Projects, teams, reports | All project operations |
| **Foreman** | Field operations, daily reports | Assigned projects only |
| **Inspector** | Quality control, certifications | Project inspection data |
| **Client** | View own projects | Read-only own data |

## Usage Examples

### 1. Check Permissions in Components
```typescript
const { checkPermission } = useAuth();

// Check if user can create quotes
const canCreateQuote = await checkPermission('quotes', 'create');
if (canCreateQuote.hasPermission) {
  // Show create button
}
```

### 2. Role-Based Rendering
```typescript
const { hasRole } = useAuth();

// Show admin features
{hasRole(['admin', 'manager']) && (
  <AdminPanel />
)}
```

### 3. Protected API Routes
```typescript
// In API route
import { checkApiPermission } from '@/middleware/rbac';

const hasPermission = await checkApiPermission(
  userId,
  'projects',
  'update',
  projectId
);
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Needed:
1. **Run Database Migrations** - Apply the RBAC schema to Supabase
2. **Test User Flows** - Verify permissions work correctly for each role
3. **Update Existing Features** - Add permission checks to existing pages

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Team Hierarchy Features**:
   - Team creation and management UI
   - Reporting structure visualization
   - Team-based permissions

2. **Territory Management**:
   - Territory assignment UI
   - Geographic boundaries
   - Territory-based data filtering

3. **Advanced Permissions**:
   - Time-based permissions
   - Approval workflows
   - Delegation system
   - Custom role creation

4. **Audit System**:
   - Audit log viewer
   - Compliance reports
   - Security analytics

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Admin can see all navigation items
- [ ] Sales can only see permitted modules
- [ ] User profile updates work correctly
- [ ] Role changes take effect immediately
- [ ] Unauthorized access shows error page
- [ ] Permission caching works properly
- [ ] Organization isolation is enforced
- [ ] Audit logs are created

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Isolation**: All queries now filter by organization_id
2. **Row Level Security**: Enabled on all sensitive tables
3. **Permission Caching**: 5-minute cache to reduce database load
4. **Audit Trail**: All permission checks can be logged
5. **Role Hierarchy**: Inherited permissions prevent gaps

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Permission Cache**: Reduces repeated database queries
2. **Indexed Columns**: All foreign keys and frequently queried fields
3. **Lazy Loading**: Navigation items load based on permissions
4. **Batch Checks**: Multiple permissions checked in single query

## Developer Notes

- Always use `checkPermission()` for feature access
- Implement resource-level checks for sensitive operations
- Use TypeScript types for role/permission safety
- Keep backward compatibility via auth-compat layer
- Test with different roles during development

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert to previous auth system using auth-compat
2. Disable middleware RBAC checks
3. Use legacy permission mappings
4. Gradually migrate features to new system
