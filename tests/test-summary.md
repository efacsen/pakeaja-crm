## Summary

1. **Core Functionality**: All unit tests for calculator utilities are passing
2. **UI Availability**: All pages load correctly and forms have proper fields
3. **Authentication Issue**: The development authentication is not redirecting to dashboard after login
4. **404 Errors**: Fixed by removing duplicate directories and cleaning build artifacts

## Recommendations

1. The authentication redirect issue needs investigation - possibly related to:
   - Next.js middleware configuration
   - Development auth implementation
   - Client-side routing

2. Once authentication is fixed, all integration tests should pass as the UI components are working correctly.

3. The 404 errors for static files have been resolved through proper build configuration.
