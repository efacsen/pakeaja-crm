# Leader Action Plan - PakeAja CRM Mobile App

## üö® Current Situation Assessment

### Completed Modules:
- ‚úÖ **Core Architecture** (100%) - Verified working
- ‚úÖ **Auth Module** (100%) - Needs verification
- üîÑ **UI Components** (90%) - Nearly complete

### Risk Assessment:
1. **Integration Risk**: We have 3 modules built in isolation
2. **Quality Risk**: No verification of auth module implementation
3. **Coordination Risk**: Can't directly access other worktrees

## üéØ Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Consolidation (TODAY)
1. **Sync all completed work to main worktree**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/sync-from-worktrees.sh
   ```

2. **Verify Integration**
   - Test if auth actually works
   - Check if UI components are usable
   - Run the integrated app
   - Fix any integration issues

3. **Create Integration Tests**
   - Auth flow end-to-end
   - UI components showcase
   - Document any missing pieces

### Phase 2: Quality Assurance (NEXT)
1. **Code Review**
   - Review auth implementation
   - Review UI components
   - Ensure coding standards met

2. **Bug Testing**
   - Test offline scenarios
   - Test error cases
   - Use bug tracking system

3. **Documentation**
   - Update README with setup instructions
   - Document component usage
   - Create API documentation

### Phase 3: Strategic Planning
1. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Which features depend on auth? (ALL)
   - Which features need UI components? (ALL)
   - Optimal development order

2. **Revised Development Order**
   ```
   Priority 1: Daily Reports (core business feature)
   Priority 2: Sync Service (enables offline-first)
   Priority 3: Canvassing (field operations)
   Priority 4: Materials (reference data)
   ```

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - 2 agents on Daily Reports (complex feature)
   - 1 agent on Sync Service
   - Hold others until Daily Reports proven

## üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Technical Actions

### 1. Create Master Sync Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# master-sync.sh - Run from mobile-app

echo "üîÑ Master Sync Starting..."

# 1. Sync all worktrees
./scripts/sync-from-worktrees.sh

# 2. Run build
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# 3. Run tests
flutter test

# 4. Run app
flutter run -d chrome
```

### 2. Create Verification Checklist
- [ ] App launches without errors
- [ ] Login screen appears and functions
- [ ] Auth state persists on reload
- [ ] UI components render correctly
- [ ] Navigation works between screens
- [ ] Offline mode indicators work
- [ ] Bug reporting works

### 3. Fix Integration Issues
Document and fix any issues found during verification.

## üìä Success Metrics

### Short Term (This Week):
- 3 modules fully integrated and working
- 0 critical bugs in integrated app
- Daily Reports module 50% complete

### Medium Term (2 Weeks):
- 5/7 modules complete
- Core business flow working end-to-end
- Ready for field testing

### Long Term (1 Month):
- All modules complete
- Full offline-first functionality
- Production-ready application

## üö¶ Go/No-Go Decision Points

1. **After Integration** (TODAY):
   - GO if: Auth + UI work together
   - NO-GO if: Major architectural issues

2. **After Daily Reports** (Week 1):
   - GO if: Core business flow works
   - NO-GO if: Performance issues

3. **After Sync Service** (Week 2):
   - GO if: Offline sync reliable
   - NO-GO if: Data integrity issues

## üí° Leadership Recommendations

### Do Now:
1. Stop new development temporarily
2. Consolidate and verify existing work
3. Fix integration issues
4. Create solid foundation

### Do Next:
1. Focus on Daily Reports (highest business value)
2. Build Sync Service in parallel
3. Use UI components extensively
4. Test offline scenarios early

### Don't Do:
1. Start multiple features simultaneously
2. Skip integration testing
3. Assume modules work together
4. Ignore technical debt

## üìù Communication Plan

### For Agents:
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Regular progress updates
- Integration checkpoints
- Shared testing responsibility

### For Stakeholders:
- Weekly progress demos
- Risk transparency
- Milestone celebrations
- Early feedback loops

**Remember**: Integration is harder than implementation. Test early, test often!
